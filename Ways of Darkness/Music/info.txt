Here is a bunch of music from Swords of Xeen. It's the same as Darkside of Xeen, and since more people probably know about Darkside, I'll call it that :). 
To record the music, I just installed the game to play with the Roland Canvas soundcard (general midi), then played in Dosbox, and then recorded the midi commands, making all of the files here. 
I edited Town_theme1.mid and Town_theme2.mid with a free program called Midget (www.silverblade.co.uk), simply just changing some of the instruments around (none of that pipe flute, give me the synth brass and new age!). 

Last Update info: Some of the files here are the same as when they were first recorded. Many, however were edited (mainly by changing the instruments around) with two programs- Midget 3.5 and NoteWorthy Composer.
